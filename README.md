# Resume Scanning and Ranking System

This repository contains a **Resume Scanning and Ranking System** built using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system aims to automatically scan resumes and rank them based on relevance to job descriptions. It supports a web-based interface using **Streamlit** for user interaction.

## Features

- **Resume Scanning**: Upload a resume and get it analyzed for key skills, experience, and qualifications.
- **Resume Ranking**: The system ranks resumes based on their relevance to a job description.
- **User-friendly Web Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with the system easily.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for creating the front end.
- **PyPDF2**: For handling PDF files.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **pandas**: For data processing and manipulation.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NLP Libraries**: (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for text processing and feature extraction.
